# CR_ContextMenuDemo

Use of context menus from within the CodeRush plugin framework (used to extend Visual Studio) is not very well documented.

This sample plugin illustrates how context menus can be used from within the CodeRush Classic (not CodeRush for Roslyn) plugin framework. The source is well commented to illustrate precisely what is happening in each place.
